GroceryOptimizer - Minimal Android Studio project
-----------------------------------------------
How to use:
1) Download and unzip into a directory.
2) Open Android Studio -> Open -> select the project folder (GroceryOptimizer).
3) Let Gradle sync. If a Gradle wrapper is missing, Android Studio will prompt you to configure Gradle.
4) Run on an emulator or device. Note: This project uses an in-memory SQLite database (data cleared on app restart).
5) If any Material components or versions need updating, adjust versions in app/build.gradle.kts.

Files included: essential Kotlin sources, layouts, manifest, and Gradle build scripts.
